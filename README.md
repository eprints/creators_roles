# Creator Roles for EPrints
Adding roles to an EPrints repository using the [CRediT](https://www.casrai.org/credit.html) taxonomy.
The initial commit is code that's been used for testing at University of Glasgow which stores the roles in a new compound field 'creators_roles' and provides associated phrases, workflow and render.
